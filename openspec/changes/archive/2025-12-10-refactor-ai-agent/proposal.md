# Change: Refactor and Complete AI Agent Implementation

## Why
The existing AI agent implementation has been simplified and consolidated into a single TaskAgent class. We need to complete the remaining features, add proper testing, documentation, and API integration.

## What Changes
- Consolidate and complete the TaskAgent implementation
- Add comprehensive testing for all agent functions
- Create API endpoints to expose AI capabilities
- Add documentation and configuration guides
- Implement proper error handling and fallbacks

## Impact
- Affected specs: ai-agent
- Affected code: app/agents/provider.py, app/routers/, tests/
- New features: API endpoints, tests, documentation
