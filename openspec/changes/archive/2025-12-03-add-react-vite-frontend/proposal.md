# Change: Add React Vite Frontend (Initial Setup)

## Why
Currently, Notify Me only provides a REST API for task management. Adding a modern, responsive web frontend will make the application more accessible to users who prefer a graphical interface over direct API interaction.

## What Changes
- [x] Set up a new React application using Vite with TypeScript
- [x] Configure ESLint, Prettier, and Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Create a responsive UI for task management (future change)
- [ ] Implement authentication and API integration (future change)
- [ ] Add real-time updates using WebSockets (future change)
- [ ] Include testing infrastructure (future change)

## Impact
- [x] New frontend application in `/frontend` directory
- [x] Additional development dependencies (React, Vite, TypeScript, etc.)
- [ ] Updated build and deployment process (future change)
- [ ] New CI/CD workflows for frontend testing and deployment (future change)

## Non-Goals
- Mobile app development (will be a separate initiative)
- Offline support (can be added later)
- Browser extensions (out of scope for this change)
- Complete frontend implementation (will be done in subsequent changes)
